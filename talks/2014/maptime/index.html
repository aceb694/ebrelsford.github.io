* how the web works
 * things have to be on a server somewhere
 * html
 * css
 * javascript

* look at http://www.antievictionmappingproject.net/combined.html
 * use developer tools, see the requests
 * briefly outline where those things come in the html
 * show js, but don't worry about it. this uses D3, which is pretty advanced

* try to replicate the same thing, using CartoDB
 * need a data source that has a time field
 * upload data, play with styling it
 * show how to share that
 * then look at Torque
