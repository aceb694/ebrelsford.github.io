            <h2>Part 1: geojson.io</h2>
            <p>Experiment with <a href="http://geojson.io">geojson.io</a>. Create some data, save the data as a gist, and submit the URL to the resulting gist. Your data should include at least five geometries and should have at least one attribute that is populated for each geometry. Try including multiple geometry types and mapping something you know fairly well. For example, you could map you commute to school with significant points of interest along the way.</p>

            <h2>Part 2: CartoDB</h2> 
            <p>Create an account at <a href="http://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> with your @newschool.edu address. Work through CartoDB's <a href="http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/01-beginners-course.html">Beginners course</a>, <a href="http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/01-beginners-course/lesson-1.html">Lesson 1</a> and <a href="http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/01-beginners-course/lesson-2.html">Lesson 2</a>. We will be talking about this more in class, so don't worry if it doesn't fully make sense. Submit a public URL to a visualization that you make using CartoDB while working through these lessons as proof that you worked through them.</p>
