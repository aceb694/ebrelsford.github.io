            <section>
                <h2>Part 1: CartoDB Visualizations</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Find at least two sets of geodata. One should be point data and one should be either lines or polygons. This data can be something that you have worked with in the past as long as you have not already mapped it using CartoDB. If you don't have any in mind, try one of these sources:
                        <ul>
                            <li>city open data portals (eg, <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us">New York's</a>)</li>
                            <li>other open data portals (eg, <a href="http://www.data.gov">data.gov</a>)</li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://wikis.uit.tufts.edu/confluence/display/GISatTufts/Online+GIS+Data+Sources">Tufts' online GIS data sources</a></li>
                            <li><a href="http://www.gbif.org">Global Biodiversity Information Facility</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Load both data sets into CartoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create two published visualizations (one for each data set) using the data, ensuring that the visualizations contain each of the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Appropriate titles and descriptions (including sources).</li>
                            <li>Useful infowindows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your visualizations may optionally have:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Legends where appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Time-animated markers where appropriate.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: CartoCSS</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Duplicate your visualizations from Part 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Modify some of the CartoCSS by hand. Make sure you include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Properties that change by zoom level</li>
                            <li>Properties that change by feature attributes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
                <p>Submit links to your work from Part 1 as well as links to your work from Part 2. Include a short statement letting me know exactly what you changed for Part 2. You may optionally choose to include a short paragraph response or summary of your work.</p>
