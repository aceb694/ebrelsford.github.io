                <h2>Part 1: Custom base maps using Mapbox Studio</h2>
                <p>Create an account with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> if you do not already have one.</p>
                <p>Watch Bill Morris's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytqw8iMYbog">Tutorial on the New Mapbox Studio</a>. It's a webinar, so there is some funny chatter (feel free to skip the first five minutes) but it is on the whole an excellent introduction to Mapbox Studio. This was recorded in October 2014. Some things have changed, and the big one is that Mapbox's free accounts now let you upload Mapbox Studio styles!</p>
                <p>Install <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a>.</p>
                <p>Using Mapbox Studio, create a custom base map based on an existing style. Change some colors (through variables), edit some code, consider swapping textures with your own. Spend an hour or so making a map style that you like and getting familiar with the options Mapbox Studio gives you.</p>
                <p>Publish the style online, add it to your CartoDB account, and publish a new visualization (or edit an old one) that incorporates your style.</p>
